            <h1>Industrial IoT with Java 11</h1>
            <p class="lead"><b>ar:kalix</b> is a set of Java libraries designed to simplify the creation of Arrowhead Framework compliant industrial IoT systems. The libraries provide a platform for modern asynchronous I/O, utilities for seamless message encoding/decoding, robust abstractions for creating and communicating with Arrowhead-compliant systems, as well as a plugin-system that makes it convenient to reuse service integrations.</p>            

            <h2>What does it look like?</h2>
            <p>In the below Java code example, a <b>system</b> provides a <b>service</b> with a single HTTP-TLS-JSON endpoint:</p>

        <span class="keyword">return</span> done();​
     }));</pre>
            </section>

            <h2>What Am I Looking At?</h2>
            <p>An Arrowhead <b>system</b> could be thought of as a client or server in a traditional distributed application, with the exception that an additional set of standards exists to ensure that these systems meet specific security, robustness and interoperability requirements. Lines 1-4 in the above example demonstrates the creation of such a system associated with a <i>key store</i>, representing the systems own certificate chain, as well as a <i>trust store</i>, representing all certificates trusted by the system.</p>
            <p>Each system may <i>provide</i> one or more <b>services</b>, which could be thought of as regular network APIs, as well as <i>consume</i> the services of other systems. Each service is concretely realized by a network <b>interface</b>, which is a specific transport protocol stack and encoding, such as HTTP-TLS-JSON or MQTT-TLS-XML. Lines 6-17 of the above example show the creation of an HTTP-TLS-JSON service with the single HTTP endpoint <b>GET /example/greetings</b>, as well as assigning that service to the system created on line 1.</p>

            <h2>Where Do I Get It?</h2>
            <p>The library is currently only available as source code downloadable via <a href="https://github.com/emanuelpalm/arrowhead-kalix">GitHub</a>, but work in underway to make it available also through the Maven Central Repository.</p>

            <h2>How Mature Is It?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://arrowhead.eu" target="_blank">Arrowhead Framework</a> is an on-going standardization and research effort aimed at enabling the creation of world-class <a href="https://arrowhead.eu/arrowheadframework/this-is-it">industrial automation systems</a>. A substantial work remains before the framework has been properly standardized, which means that any implementation is bound to be unstable. Work on this library commensed as a response to the need for a suitable set of abstractions while evaluating the framework. If you are interested in contributing to its maturity and further development, please contact Emanuel Palm via <b>[emanuel DOT palm AT arkalix DOT se]</b>.</p>
